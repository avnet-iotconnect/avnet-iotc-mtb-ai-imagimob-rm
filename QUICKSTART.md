## 3. Hardware Setup
* **PSoC 6 AI Kit:** Connect your PC to the **J1** USB header on the board. A new USB device should be detected.
* **Pioneer Kit:** Connect the SHIELD_XENSIV_A board to the arduino connector. Use the right-side USB-C connector on 062S2-AI and the USB connector on the shorter edge of the 062S2-43012.

## 4. Flash the Firmware
* **Download** and **Install** the latest (tested with v5.2) [ModusToolbox Programming Tools](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.modustoolboxprogtools) (Right-Click, "Open link in new tab")
* **Download** and **unzip** the pre-compiled [avnet-iotc-mtb-ai-imagimob-rm-v1.0.0.zip](https://downloads.iotconnect.io/partners/infineon/demos/avnet-iotc-mtb-ai-imagimob-rm-v1.0.0.zip) firmware package.
The package will contain several .hex files with the board name as the prefix and model type as suffix. 
* Launch the **ModusToolbox Programmer** software and update the firmware if prompted.
* Next to the **Programmer** drop-down, ensure the item beginning with **KitProg3** is selected
* Click the dropdown box next to **Board** and select the **CY8CKIT-062S2-AI** or **CY8CKIT-062S2-43012** depending on the board that needs to be programmed.
* Click **File -> Open** and select the corresponding firmware .hex file downloaded.
For example, if trying out the *Siren* model using the CY8CKIT-062S2-AI, select the ```062S2-ai-imagimob-rm-siren.hex```.
* Click **Connect**.
* Click **Program**.
* Wait for the "Device programmed successfully" message to appear at the bottom.
* **Close** the programmer.

## 5. Serial Port Setup
* Launch the Serial Terminal application (TeraTerm)
* If using TeraTerm, it's recommended you enable `Local Echo` in the "Setup" -> "Terminal" menu, otherwise text input will not be visible.
* Configure settings as shown below:
  * Port: (Select the COM port with the device)
  * Speed: `115200`
  * Data: `8 bits`
  * Parity: `none`
  * Stop Bits: `1`
  * Flow Control: `none`
  * In the Transmit Delay section of the serial port setting, enter 10 for both per-character and per-line delay. 
* After setup, connect and reset the board.

## 7. Cloud Account Setup
An /IOTCONNECT account with AWS backend is required.  If you need to create an account, a free trial subscription is available.
The free subscription may be obtained directly from iotconnect.io or through the AWS Marketplace.

* Option #1 [/IOTCONNECT via AWS Marketplace](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/iotconnect_aws_marketplace.md) **(Recommended)** - 60 day trial; AWS account creation required
* Option #2 [/IOTCONNECT via iotconnect.io](https://subscription.iotconnect.io/subscribe?cloud=aws) - 30 day trial; no credit card required

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to check any SPAM folder for the temporary password after registering.

See the /IOTCONNECT [Subscription Information](https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/main/documentation/iotconnect/subscription/subscription.md) for more details on the trial.

## 8. Acquire /IOTCONNECT Account Information
Login to /IOTCONNECT using the using the link below:  
[https://console.iotconnect.io](https://console.iotconnect.io)

The Company ID (**CPID**) and Environment (**ENV**) variables identifying your /IOTCONNECT account must be configured for the device.
* Take note of these values for later reference located in the "Settings" -> "Key Vault" section of the platform. See image below.

<img src="https://github.com/avnet-iotconnect/avnet-iotconnect.github.io/blob/bbdc9f363831ba607f40805244cbdfd08c887e78/assets/cpid_and_env.png" width=600>


## 9. Configure the Board

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> There is no local echo in the serial terminal when typing or pasting values (unless you enabled this option in the TeraTerm settings).
> If a mistake is made, the board must be reset and this section repeated.

* Verify the following output is visible in the terminal:  `Please enter your device configuration`
* If not, reset the board.

> [!NOTE] 
> To change an existing configuration reset the board and press `y` and then `ENTER` when prompted.

* Enter the **Platform** for which you subscribed: `aws` (for AWS) or `az` (for Azure)
* Enter the **CPID** acquired from the key vault in Step 8
* Enter the **ENV** (Environment) acquired from the key vault in Step 8
* Enter your **WiFi SSID**
* Enter your **WiFi Password**

The device will configure itself and reboot.

The application will display the auto-generated certificate from flash upon boot.

> [!CAUTION]  
> This certificate will be re-generated every time you re-flash the board because the flash section
> where the certificate and private key are stored will be erased.
> In this case, you will need to delete your device from /IOTCONNECT and re-create the device with the new certificate.
> If you wish to avoid this, you should use the Developer Guide and 
> have your device credentials compiled into the application.

* **Copy** the *Device Certificate* from the terminal including the "BEGIN" and "END" lines.
* Open a text editor, such as notepad, paste in the certificate, and save the file as `cert.txt`
